- All-AI Project Refactoring Summary
-
- This project has been refactored to address the following issues:
-
- 1.  State Management:
- - Implemented Zustand for centralized state management
- - Created stores for auth, chats, and messages
- - Hooks now only call server actions and manipulate Zustand state
-
- 2.  Server Side Rendering:
- - Minimized "use client" directive usage
- - Separated client and server components appropriately
- - Server components handle initial data fetching and authentication
-
- 3.  Component Management:
- - Clear separation between server and client components
- - Proper data flow through Zustand stores
- - Optimized re-rendering patterns
-
- Key Changes:
-
- Stores (/src/stores/):
- - auth-store.ts: User authentication state
- - chat-store.ts: Chat list and current chat state
- - message-store.ts: Messages organized by chat ID
-
- Hooks (/src/hooks/):
- - use-auth.ts: Auth operations + Zustand state management
- - use-chats.ts: Chat CRUD operations + Zustand state management
- - use-messages.ts: Message operations + Zustand state management
-
- Components:
- - Server components: Main pages, layouts (authentication checks)
- - Client components: Interactive UI, forms, real-time features
-
- Pages:
- - / (homepage): Server component with client component for interactivity
- - /chat: Server component with authentication
- - /chat/[id]: Server component for individual chat pages
-
- Benefits:
- - Improved SEO and initial load performance
- - Better user experience with persistent state
- - Cleaner architecture with separation of concerns
- - Reduced prop drilling and state duplication
- - Optimized bundle size with minimal client-side JavaScript
