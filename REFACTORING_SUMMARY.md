# All-AI Project Refactoring Summary

## Design System Refactoring

### Glass Morphism Design

- Added glass morphism styling with backdrop blur and transparency
- Implemented consistent border and shadow variables
- Created dedicated glass components (GlassCard, GlassButton)
- Updated existing UI components to use glass styling

### Updated Color System

- Enhanced color palette with AI model-specific colors
- Added semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Implemented glass-specific color variables
- Better dark mode support with appropriate glass styling

### Typography and Spacing

- Created consistent typography system with CSS variables
- Added responsive spacing scale
- Improved font management with variables
- Enhanced animation system with glass-compatible transitions

### Components

- Updated Button, Badge, Input, and Dialog components with glass morphism
- Created AI model-specific message bubble styling
- Added consistent shadows and borders
- Improved hover and focus states for better UX

## Architecture Refactoring

### Features Layer

- Implemented feature-based organization in `/src/features`
- Created auth feature with actions, hooks, and components
- Created chat feature with actions, hooks, and components
- Added proper exports through index files

### Infrastructure Layer

- Created `/src/infrastructure` directory for external services
- Moved Supabase client to `/src/infrastructure/supabase`
- Moved AI client and services to `/src/infrastructure/ai`
- Added proper documentation and type safety

### State Management

- All stores are now in `/src/core/stores`:
  - `auth-store.ts`: User authentication state
  - `chat-store.ts`: Chat list and current chat state
  - `message-store.ts`: Messages organized by chat ID
- Feature-specific hooks interact with stores

### Component Architecture

- Server components: Main pages, layouts (authentication checks)
- Client components: Interactive UI, forms, real-time features
- UI components in `/src/components/ui`
- Feature-specific components in `/src/features/{feature}/components`

## Benefits

- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced type safety and documentation
- Consistent design system with glass morphism
- Feature-based architecture for easier scaling
- Clear boundaries between infrastructure, core, and features
- Better dark mode support with appropriate styling

## Implemented Changes

### Moved Components to Features

- Moved `chat-input.tsx` to `/src/features/chat/components/`
- Moved `chat-window.tsx` to `/src/features/chat/components/`
- Moved `message-bubble.tsx` to `/src/features/chat/components/`
- Moved `model-badge.tsx` to `/src/features/chat/components/`
- Moved `sidebar.tsx` to `/src/features/common/layout/`
- Updated import paths throughout the application

### Updated Server Actions

- Moved auth actions from `/src/app/actions/auth.ts` to `/src/features/auth/actions.ts`
- Moved chat actions from `/src/app/actions/chat.ts` to `/src/features/chat/actions.ts`
- Moved message actions from `/src/app/actions/message.ts` to `/src/features/chat/message-actions.ts`
- Added proper documentation and type safety

### Infrastructure Layer

- Created dedicated AI service in `/src/infrastructure/ai/`
- Added Supabase clients in `/src/infrastructure/supabase/`
  - `browser.ts`: Client-side Supabase client
  - `server.ts`: Server-side Supabase client

### Core Layer

- Moved types to `/src/core/types/`
  - `database.types.ts`: Supabase database types
  - `ai.types.ts`: AI model types
  - `models.ts`: Domain models
- Moved stores to `/src/core/stores/`
  - Proper separation of authentication, chat, and message stores
- - Reduced prop drilling and state duplication
- - Optimized bundle size with minimal client-side JavaScript
