# Visual Updates for Enhanced User-Friendliness

## Purpose
The purpose of this update is to update the overall product for better user interface and user experience.

## Problem Proposal
The identified problems of this product, related to this update includes, but are not limited to, the following:
- main and sub buttons are not clearly distinguishable
- hover and click effects are absent for most UI components
- a simple spinner after submitting a prompt confuses the user into thinking that there is an error

## Solution Proposal
The solutions must resolve the problems listed in the ## Problem Proposal. You should find more relevant problems and resolve that problem.
For the spinner issue listed in ## Problem Proposal, I want you to modify it so that the agent shows what it's thinking or processing.
Additionally, I want the chat to resemble a messenger interface more, so that it has a chat bubble, etc.
